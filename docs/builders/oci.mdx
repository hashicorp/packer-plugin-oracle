# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Builder

Type: `oracle-oci`
Artifact BuilderId: `packer.oracle.oci`

The `oracle-oci` Packer builder is able to create new custom images for use
with [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://cloud.oracle.com) (OCI). The builder
takes a base image, runs any provisioning necessary on the base image after
launching it, and finally snapshots it creating a reusable custom image.

It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with the [Key Concepts and
Terminology](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm)
prior to using this builder if you have not done so already.

The builder _does not_ manage images. Once it creates an image, it is up to you
to use it or delete it.

## Policy Reference

When running this plugin as a non-administrative user, you will need to have OCI policies defined which will enable Packer to do its job.  

The following represent minimal required policies for the plugin to operate:

```
Allow group PackerGroup to manage instance-family in compartment ${COMPARTMENT_NAME}
Allow group PackerGroup to manage instance-images in compartment ${COMPARTMENT_NAME}
Allow group PackerGroup to use virtual-network-family in compartment ${COMPARTMENT_NAME}
Allow group PackerGroup to use compute-image-capability-schema in tenancy
```

This example assumes the user running Packer is in a group named 'PackerGroup'.  You will need to update ${COMPARTMENT_NAME} to the name of the
compartment in which the plugin is managing resources.

For more details on working with OCI Policies, please refer to the [OCI Policy Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/policiesgs/get-started-with-policies.htm)

## Authentication

There are three authentication methods available for the OCI builder. The API
Signing Key of the `DEFAULT` profile in the OCI
 [SDK and CLI Configuration File](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm#SDK_and_CLI_Configuration_File)
 will be used by default.

### API Signing Key

The OCI REST API requires that requests be signed with the RSA public key
associated with your
[IAM](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Identity/Concepts/overview.htm)
user account. For a comprehensive example of how to configure the required
authentication see the documentation on [Required Keys and
OCIDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/apisigningkey.htm)
([Oracle Cloud
IDs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/identifiers.htm)).

### Instance Principal

If you run Packer on an OCI compute instance, you can configure Packer to use the
[Instance Principal](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)
associated with that instance to authenticate instead of an API Signing Key that
is associated with a specific user. This method requires the creation of appropriately configured
[Dynamic Groups](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/managingdynamicgroups.htm)
and [Policies](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policygetstarted.htm).

The [`use_instance_principals`](https://www.packer.io/docs/builders/oracle/oci#use_instance_principals)
parameter is used to enable this method.

The [`oci_instance_principals.pkr.hcl`](/example/oci_instance_principals.pkr.hcl)
and [`oci_instance_principals.json`](/example/oci_instance_principals.json) examples can be used as a reference for
configuring this authentication method.

### Security Token

[Token-based authentication](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/clitoken.htm)
requires you to interactively authenticate a session using the OCI CLI and a web
browser. The token that is created has an extremely limited TTL and must be
refreshed every hour for up to 24 hours. However, this method allows for
authentication using non-SCIM supported federated identity providers.

To use token-based authentication, start a new session using the CLI's
[`oci session authenticate`](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/clitoken.htm#Starting)
command and provide the path to the configuration file as the `access_cfg_file`
configuration parameter and the name of the profile as the `access_cfg_file_account`
configuration parameter.

The [`oci_security_token.pkr.hcl`](/example/oci_security_token.pkr.hcl) and
[`oci_security_token.json`](/example/oci_security_token.json) examples can be
used as a reference for this method.

## Configuration Reference

There are many configuration options available for the `oracle-oci` builder. In
addition to the options listed here, a
[communicator](/packer/docs/templates/legacy_json_templates/communicator) can be configured for this
builder.

In addition to the options defined there, a private key file
can also be supplied to override the typical auto-generated key:

@include 'packer-plugin-sdk/communicator/SSH-Private-Key-File-not-required.mdx'

### Required configuration parameters

- `availability_domain` (string) - The name of the [Availability
  Domain](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm)
  within which a new instance is launched and provisioned. The names of the
  Availability Domains have a prefix that is specific to your
  [tenancy](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Concepts/concepts.htm#two).

  To get a list of the Availability Domains, use the
  [ListAvailabilityDomains](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/identity/latest/AvailabilityDomain/ListAvailabilityDomains)
  operation, which is available in the IAM Service API.

- `base_image_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the [base
  image](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/Compute/References/images.htm)
  to use. This is the unique identifier of the image that will be used to
  launch a new instance and provision it.

  To get a list of the accepted image OCIDs, use the
  [ListImages](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Image/ListImages)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

- `base_image_filter` (map of strings) - As an alternative to providing `base_image_ocid`,
  the user can supply search criteria, and Packer will use the the most recent image that meets
  all search criteria. If no image meets all search criteria, Packer returns an error. The
  following fields, if specified, must match exactly:

  - `compartment_id` - The OCID of the compartment to find the image. If not specified, will use `compartment_ocid`
    used for the instance.
  - `display_name` - The full name of the image, e.g., `Oracle-Linux-7.8-2020.05.26-0`
  - `operating_system` - The operating system used on the image, e.g., `Oracle Linux`
  - `operating_system_version` - The version of the operating system on the image, e.g., `7.8`
  - `shape` - A shape that the image supports. If not specified, will use `shape` used for the instance

  Additionally, the following field takes a regular expression:

  - `display_name_search` - a regular expression for the display name, e.g., `^Oracle-Linux`. This
    is ignored if `display_name` is also specified under `base_image_filter`. If no images match
    the expression, Packer returns an error. If multiple images match, the most recent is used.

  `base_image_filter` is ignored if `base_image_ocid` is also specified.

- `compartment_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the
  [compartment](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/GSG/Tasks/choosingcompartments.htm) that the instance will run in.

- `shape` (string) - The template that determines the number of CPUs, amount
  of memory, and other resources allocated to a newly created instance.

  To get a list of the available shapes, use the
  [ListShapes](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/Shape/ListShapes)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

  When using flexible shapes, `ocpus` must be set.

- `subnet_ocid` (string) - The name of the subnet within which a new instance
  is launched and provisioned.

  To get a list of your subnets, use the
  [ListSubnets](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/latest/Subnet/ListSubnets)
  operation available in the Core Services API.

  Note: the subnet must be configured to allow access via your chosen
  [communicator](/packer/docs/communicators) (communicator defaults to
  [SSH tcp/22](/packer/docs/communicators/ssh#ssh_port)).


### Authentication parameters

Each of the following configuration parameters is either **mandatory** or **unacceptable**
based on which authentication method is used.

- `use_instance_principals` (boolean) - Whether to use [Instance
  Principals](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm)

  `access_cfg_file_account`, `region`, `tenancy_ocid`, `user_ocid`, `key_file`, `fingerprint`,
  `pass_phrase` parameters will cause an invalid configuration error.
  Defaults to `false`.

- `access_cfg_file` (string) - The path to the [OCI config
  file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm).
  This parameter is _optional_ when using token-based authentication.
  This parameter _cannot_ be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.
  Defaults to `$HOME/.oci/config`.

- `access_cfg_file_account` (string) - The specific account in the [OCI config
  file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) to use.
  This parameter is _mandatory_ when using token-based authentication.
  This parameter _cannot_ be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.
  Defaults to `DEFAULT`.


### Overriding authentication defaults

The following parameters can be used to override the default value provided by
or configured for the default OCI CLI authenticaton profile.

- `region` (string) - An Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region. Overrides value provided by the
  [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)

  by the [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `fingerprint` (string) - Fingerprint for the OCI API signing key. Overrides value provided by the
  [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm) if
  present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

- `pass_phrase` (string) - Pass phrase used to decrypt the OCI API signing key. Overrides value provided
  by the [OCI config file](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/Concepts/sdkconfig.htm)
  if present. This cannot be used along with the `use_instance_principals` key.

  ### Additional configuration parameters

- `skip_create_image` (bool) - Skip creating the image. Useful for setting to `true` during a build test stage. Defaults to `false`.

- `image_name` (string) - The name to assign to the resulting custom image.

- `image_compartment_ocid` (string) - The OCID of the target compartment for the resulting image. Defaults to `compartment_ocid`.

- `instance_name` (string) - The name to assign to the instance used for the image creation process.
  If not set a name of the form `instanceYYYYMMDDhhmmss` will be used.

- `instance_tags` (map of strings) - Add one or more freeform tags to the instance used for the
  image creation process.

- `instance_defined_tags_json` (string) - Json string to add one or more defined tags for a given namespace
   to the instance used for the image creation process. Only works on HCL2 templates. For old-style JSON templates,
   use [instance_defined_tags](#instance_defined_tags) instead.

  ```hcl
  instance_defined_tags_json = jsonencode({
    "Operations" = {
      "Environment" = "prod"
      "Team"        = "CostCenter"
    }
  })
  ```

- `instance_defined_tags` (map of maps of strings) - Add one or more defined tags for a given namespace
  to the instance used for the image creation process. Only works on old-style JSON templates. For HCL2 templates,
  use [instance_defined_tags_json](#instance_defined_tags_json) instead.

- `create_vnic_details` (map of strings) - Specify details for the virtual network interface card (VNIC)
  that is attached to the instance. Possible keys (all optional) are: `assign_public_ip` (bool),
  `display_name` (string), `hostname_lable` (string), `nsg_ids` (list), `private_ip` (string),
  `skip_source_dest_check` (bool), `subnet_id` (string), `tags` (map of string). Besides the previous keys, the `defined_tags`
  (map of maps of strings) is also available on old-style JSON templates, while `defined_tags_json` (string) is the json
  string equivalent variant for HCL2 templates. See
  [the Oracle docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Network/Tasks/managingVNICs.htm)
  for more information about VNICs.

- `disk_size` (int64) - The size of the boot volume in GBs. Minimum value is 50 and maximum value is 16384 (16TB).
  Sets the [BootVolumeSizeInGBs](https://godoc.org/github.com/oracle/oci-go-sdk/core#InstanceConfigurationInstanceSourceViaImageDetails)
  when launching the instance. Defaults to `50`.

- `image_launch_mode` (string) - Specifies the configuration mode for launching instances.
  Valid values are `"NATIVE"`, `"EMULATED"`, `"PARAVIRTUALIZED"`, and `"CUSTOM"`. See the
  [Oracle CLI docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/tools/oci-cli/2.12.5/oci_cli_docs/cmdref/compute/image/create.html#cmdoption-launch-mode)
  for more information about these modes.

- `nic_attachment_type` (string) - Emulation type for the NIC card of the image.
  Valid values are `"E1000"`, `"VFIO"`, and `"PARAVIRTUALIZED"`. For applications that require VFIO networking for performance reasons this setting allows for the image to default to this network type. 

- `use_private_ip` (boolean) - Use private ip addresses to connect to the
  instance via ssh.

- `shape_config` (object) - The shape configuration for an instance. The shape configuration determines the resources
  allocated to an instance. Options:

  - `memory_in_gbs` (optional) (float32) - The total amount of memory, in gigabytes, available to the instance.
  - `baseline_ocpu_utilization` (optional) (string) - The baseline OCPU utilization for a burstable instance.
    Valid values are `"BASELINE_1_8"`, `"BASELINE_1_2"`and `"BASELINE_1_1"`.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

- `metadata` (map of strings) - Metadata optionally contains custom metadata
key/value pairs provided in the configuration. While this can be used to
set metadata\["user_data"\] the explicit "user_data" and
"user_data_file" values will have precedence. An instance's metadata can
be obtained from at [http://169.254.169.254](http://169.254.169.254) on
the launched instance.
<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

- `user_data` (string) - User data to be used by cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Generally speaking, it is easier to use the
  `user_data_file`, but you can use this option to put either the plaintext
  data or the base64 encoded data directly into your Packer config. Packer
  will not automatically wait for a user script to finish before shutting
  down the instance this must be handled in a provisioner.

- `user_data_file` (string) - Path to a file to be used as user data by
  cloud-init. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/api/#/en/iaas/20160918/LaunchInstanceDetails)
  for more details. Example: `"user_data_file": "./boot_config/myscript.sh"`

- `tags` (map of strings) - Add one or more freeform tags to the resulting
  custom image. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'tag1': 'value1'
  'tag2': 'value2'
```

- `defined_tags_json` (string) - JSON string to add one or more defined tags for a given namespace to the resulting
  custom image. Only works on HCL2 templates. For old-style JSON templates, use [defined_tags](#defined_tags) instead.

  ```hcl
  defined_tags_json = jsonencode({
    "tag1" = {
      "tag1.2" = "value1"
    }
    "tag2" = "value2"
  })
  ```

  See [the Oracle docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm) for more details.

- `defined_tags` (map of map of strings) - Add one or more defined tags for a given namespace to the resulting
  custom image. Only works on old-style JSON templates. For HCL2 templates,
use [defined_tags_json](#defined_tags_json) instead. See [the Oracle
  docs](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/taggingoverview.htm)
  for more details. Example:

```yaml
'tags':
  'namespace': { 'tag1': 'value1', 'tag2': 'value2' }
```

## Basic Example

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
substituted with the letter `a` and OCIDS have been shortened for brevity.


**HCL2**

```hcl
source "oracle-oci" "example" {
  availability_domain = "aaaa:PHX-AD-1"
  base_image_ocid     = "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa"
  compartment_ocid    = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa"
  image_name          = "ExampleImage"
  shape               = "VM.Standard1.1"
  ssh_username        = "opc"
  subnet_ocid         = "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.oracle-oci.example"]
}

```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa",
  "compartment_ocid": "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa",
  "image_name": "ExampleImage",
  "shape": "VM.Standard1.1",
  "ssh_username": "opc",
  "subnet_ocid": "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa",
  "type": "oracle-oci"
}
```



## Using Instance Principals

Here is a basic example. Note that account specific configuration has been
substituted with the letter `a` and OCIDS have been shortened for brevity.

**HCL2**

```hcl
source "oracle-oci" "example" {
  availability_domain     = "aaaa:PHX-AD-1"
  base_image_ocid         = "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa"
  compartment_ocid        = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa"
  image_name              = "ExampleImage"
  shape                   = "VM.Standard2.1"
  ssh_username            = "opc"
  subnet_ocid             = "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa"
  use_instance_principals = "true"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.oracle-oci.example"]
}

```

**JSON**

```json
{
  "use_instance_principals": "true",
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_ocid": "ocid1.image.oc1.phx.aaaaaaaa5yu6pw3riqtuhxzov7fdngi4tsteganmao54nq3pyxu3hxcuzmoa",

  "shape": "VM.Standard2.1",
  "ssh_username": "opc",
  "subnet_ocid": "ocid1.subnet.oc1..aaa",
  "type": "oracle-oci"
}
```



```shell-session
[opc@packerhost ~]$ packer build packer.json
oracle-oci: output will be in this color.

```

## Assigning Tags and Network Security Groups to the Instance

Tags are useful for breaking down costs and usage. The keys `instance_tags`
and `instance_defined_tags` are assigned to the temporary instance,
whereas `tags` and `defined_tags` are assigned to the resulting image.

Network Security Groups (NSGs) are used for granting networking permissions
to the instance. Depending on network (VCN and subnet) setup, this may be
required for Packer to successfully SSH into the instance. NSGs are a property
of the virtual network interface card (VNIC) attached to the instance, and
are listed in `nsg_ids` under `create_vnic_details`.

**HCL2**

```hcl
locals {
  timestamp = "${formatdate("YYYYMMDDhhmmss", timestamp())}"
}

source "oracle-oci" "base-image-example" {
  availability_domain = "aaaa:PHX-AD-1"
  base_image_ocid     = "ocid1.image.oc1.iad.aaa"
  compartment_ocid    = "ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaa"
  create_vnic_details {
    assign_public_ip = "false"
    display_name     = "testing-123"
    nsg_ids          = ["ocid1.networksecuritygroup.oc1.iad.aaa"]
  }
  image_name = "my-image-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_defined_tags_json = jsonencode({
    "Operations" = {
      "Environment" = "prod"
      "Team"        = "CostCenter"
    }
  })
  instance_name = "packer-build-${local.timestamp}"
  instance_tags = {
    testing = "yes"
  }
  shape       = "VM.Standard.E2.1"
  subnet_ocid = "ocid1.subnet.oc1.iad.aaa"
  tags = {

  }
  use_private_ip = "true"
}

build {
  sources = ["source.oracle-oci.base-image-example"]
}
```

    }
  }]
}
```



## Base Image Filter Example

Note that `base_image_filter` gets passed as a string, then interpreted as a
regular expression. This means that all back-slashes must be doubled, e.g.,
use `\\w+` to mean `\w+`, and `\\\\` to create the regular expression equivalent
of `\\` (which will search for a literal back-slash).

```json
{
  "name":                "base-image-{{isotime \"20060102030405\"}}",
  "type":                "oracle-oci",
  "availability_domain": "aaaa:PHX-AD-1",
  "base_image_filter": {
    "operating_system": "Oracle Linux",
    "operating_system_version": "7.8",
    "display_name_search": "^Oracle-Linux-7\\.8-2020\\.\\d+"
  }
  ...
}
```
